Design a network in Cisco Packet Tracer to connects ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments through the following: 
* Each department should contain at least two PCs.
* Appropriate number of switches and routers should be used in the network.
* Using the given network 192.168.40.0, all interfaces sould be configured with correct IP addresses, subnet mask and gateways.
* All devices in the network should be connected using appropriate cables.
* Test communication between devices in both ACCOUNTS and DELIVERY departments.

Technologies Implemented
1. Creating a Simple Network using a Router and Access Layer Switch.
2. Connecting Networking devices with Correct cabling.
3. Connecting two Networks using a Router.
4. Subnetting and IP Addressing.
5. Assigning IP Addresses to Router's interfaces.
6. Static IP Address allocation to Host Devices.
7. Test and Verifying Network Communication.
